I have developed an innovative application designed to detect cancer using a sophisticated model I created, which analyzes images to identify cancerous cells. This application not only serves as a diagnostic tool but also offers a feature that provides users with the latest news related to cancer, keeping them informed about advancements and developments in cancer research and treatment. The application is crafted using Kotlin for a seamless, intuitive user interface, while the underlying model that powers the detection is built with Python, known for its robust data handling and machine learning capabilities. By integrating these technologies, the application offers a comprehensive approach to cancer awareness and diagnosis, making it a valuable resource for both medical professionals and individuals seeking to stay informed about their health.##  **Tech Stack**
